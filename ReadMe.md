## Description

Eclectic DFW is a single-page application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows users to explore various music venues, view live music events, read and post reviews, and manage their accounts. This application aims to provide a comprehensive platform for music enthusiasts to discover and engage with their favorite venues.

## User Story

As a developer, I want an application that shows different music venues.
It is done when this application uses the MERN stack and has the following pages:

- Explore Page
- Live Music Page
- Music Venue Page
- Login/Sign-Up Page

It is done when there is a login page for users to log into, and users have the option to post reviews on the Explore Page.
